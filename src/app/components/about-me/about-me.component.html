                <p>Hi. I'm Nagaraju Uppala, an Indian UI/UX & Package designer. Little angry man, but not on the other hand. Always thinking about new things and fashion. A person's attitude will not help them, but their sedition and ideas will. To learn new things, I always follow some great
                    people,
                    artists, and blogs. My parents are my biggest supporters, but my grandfather is my world, and he is no longer with us. I enjoy Sharing my knowledge to my friends and grabe from them. I always delegate my work to others and solicit their feedback because only I will know what
                    mistakes
                    I made. so that I can improve my abilities.</p>

                <p>Working with people and organizations motivates me the most as a graphic designer. In addition, during my two years of work, I've been in charge of generating social media posters, scrips storyboards, concept artworks, product design, Ui/Ux development, product shoot ideas for
                    brand
                    development, newsletters, and video editing.</p>

                <p>Moreover I enjoy spending time with friends over a good cup of tea and watching movies and television shows. My hobbies include playing video games, chess, Kabaddi, and cricket. While traveling, I prefer Melody Tunes, but when I'm in the mood for a party, I prefer mass songs.
                    Moreover i love taking photographs of nature. In addition, I enjoy cooking and serving my friends.</p>

                <p>Always make something new.</p>

                <p>Art. Food. Whatever. Enjoy the Beauty of it.</p>

                figure out <b>what needs to be improved,</b> make sure the way users will <b>interact with it makes sense,</b> and guide our <b>future work on the project.</b>
